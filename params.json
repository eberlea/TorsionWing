(in press). A new twist on \r\ngyroscopic sensing: body rotations lead to torsion in flapping, flexing \r\ninsect wings. Journal of the Royal Society, Interface. \r\n```\r\nAs described in our supplementary methods and figures, \"we supply all data collected from our experimental and computational models along with the code we wrote for the computational wing model.  We saved all of the data in ‘RawData_Experimental_and_Computational.mat’, which\r\ncan be opened using MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The remaining 20 files are scripts that can be executed in MATLAB. We created the following files for the computational model:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    List of simulations: \r\n      ‘runsimulations.m’ \r\n    Main functions:\r\n      ‘flappermodel_doublesine.m’\r\n      ‘flappermodel_singlesine.m’ \r\n    Sub functions:\r\n      ‘createODEfile.m’\r\n      ‘PlateODE.m’ (generated by ‘createODEfile.m’) \r\n      ‘funcCa.m’\r\n      ‘shape2.m’\r\n      ‘shapefunc2.m’\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe used the rest of the files for post processing, where the main figure plotting scripts are ‘plot_Figures4to8.m’ and ‘plot_FiguresS1-S5.m’.\"\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
